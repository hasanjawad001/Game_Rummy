# Reinforcement Learning: Rummy Game

This project implements a modified version of the Rummy card game using reinforcement learning. The game environment and agent were developed as part of the Machine Learning course in my PhD program.

### Key Concepts
- **Algorithms**: SARSA, Q-learning
- **Strategy**: Epsilon-greedy for exploration/exploitation
- **Focus**: States, actions, rewards in a Rummy game environment

The agent learns to play Rummy by optimizing its actions to maximize cumulative rewards.
