    "Rummy is mostly played by 4 players where each player get 10 cards and rest of placed as closed deck.  \n",
    "\n",
    "But for this assignment to keep it simple, we have changed some rules, reduced the deck of cards and distribution of the cards among each player. Otherwise, the our Q table would be large to handle on our local machines.  \n",
    "\n",
    "So in this game each player will get 3 cards randomly from 'A' to '5'. With each turn you have to pick a card either from the pile of closed or open cards depending on the cards you have. After that you have to select a card to drop to the pile from your deck. Your goal is to make all of your 3 cards of same number. As soon as one player reaches the goal state, it will meld the cards and game will stop and all other player will get score as the sum of their cards in hand. Player with minimum score will win the game.  \n",

    "Each player will play for the 10 rounds and if nobody reach to the meld stage then each will player will get score equivalent to the sum of their cards in hand.\n",
